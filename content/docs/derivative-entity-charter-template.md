### Status
Governing charter template.  
Not marketing.

This document defines the authority boundaries, obligations, and constraints of a derivative entity operating under the stewardship of PlainSight Lab.

This document is binding upon adoption.

---

## Article I — Entity Definition

This charter governs the derivative entity identified as:

**Entity Name:** _[To be specified]_  
**Entity Type:** Product / Implementation  
**Stewarding Authority:** PlainSight Lab  
**Canonical Standards Source:** Invariant.org

This entity exists to implement, operationalize, or otherwise apply canonical specifications and governance frameworks stewarded by PlainSight Lab and published via Invariant.org.

This entity is not a source of canonical truth.

---

## Article II — Authority and Subordination

### Section 2.1 — Lack of Epistemic Authority

The derivative entity does not possess epistemic authority.

It may not:
- define canonical truth,
- alter protocol invariants,
- reinterpret specifications for convenience,
- or represent itself as a governance authority.

All canonical truth is defined upstream.

---

### Section 2.2 — Subordination to Standards

This entity is explicitly subordinate to:

1. The **PlainSight Lab Internal Constitution**
2. Canonical specifications and invariants published via **Invariant.org**

In the event of conflict:
- standards and invariants prevail over product incentives,
- correctness prevails over usability, growth, or revenue,
- compliance is mandatory, not optional.

---

## Article III — Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this entity is to:

- provide a concrete implementation of canonical standards,
- demonstrate correctness in practice,
- surface edge cases and feedback into governance processes,
- and operate within explicitly defined constraints.

This entity exists to make standards real, not to redefine them.

---

## Article IV — Prohibited Authority

The derivative entity is expressly prohibited from:

- claiming protocol ownership,
- asserting governance control,
- shipping behavior that violates frozen invariants,
- or bypassing formal amendment processes.

Temporary deviation for experimentation may occur only when:
- clearly labeled as non-canonical,
- isolated from production pathways,
- and documented upstream.

---

## Article V — Governance Obligations

### Section 5.1 — Compliance by Default

Compliance with canonical specifications is the default operating condition.

Deviation requires:
- explicit documentation,
- explicit justification,
- and explicit acknowledgment of non-compliance.

Silent divergence is prohibited.

---

### Section 5.2 — Feedback Duty

This entity has an affirmative obligation to report:
- implementation friction,
- ambiguity in specifications,
- emergent failure modes,
- and correction cost signals.

Feedback flows upstream. Authority does not.

---

## Article VI — Incentive Containment

This entity acknowledges that product incentives naturally diverge from governance incentives.

Accordingly:
- growth, usability, and revenue goals are subordinate to correctness,
- governance constraints may not be relaxed to meet market pressure,
- unresolved conflicts must be escalated, not worked around.

Product success does not justify protocol deviation.

---

## Article VII — Human Authority and AI Systems

AI systems used within this entity are strictly advisory.

AI systems may:
- assist with analysis,
- support implementation,
- and surface risks or inconsistencies.

AI systems may not:
- enforce invariants,
- make governance decisions,
- or act autonomously in production systems.

Final authority remains human and explicit.

---

## Article VIII — Branding and Representation

This entity may not:
- represent itself as a standards body,
- imply ownership of canonical truth,
- or dilute the authority of PlainSight Lab or Invariant.org.

All external representations must preserve correct authority boundaries.

---

## Article IX — Audit and Corrective Action

This entity is subject to audit by PlainSight Lab.

Upon identification of violation:
- corrective action is mandatory,
- remediation timelines may be imposed,
- continued operation may be conditioned on compliance.

Refusal to correct invalidates legitimacy.

---

## Article X — Amendment and Termination

This charter may not be amended unilaterally by the derivative entity.

Amendments require:
- upstream approval,
- documented rationale,
- and consistency with canonical invariants.

PlainSight Lab reserves the authority to:
- suspend,
- restructure,
- or terminate the derivative entity
if this charter is violated.

---

## Adoption

This charter is binding upon formal adoption by the derivative entity.

All operational decisions, implementations, and representations must conform to its articles.
