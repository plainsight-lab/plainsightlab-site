## Purpose

This policy defines how security, safety, and correctness issues should be responsibly disclosed to PlainSight Lab.

Its purpose is to:
- reduce harm,
- preserve system integrity,
- and enable correction before exploitation.

This policy is not a marketing instrument. It exists to support correctness under adversarial conditions.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to disclosures related to:
- canonical specifications stewarded by PlainSight Lab,
- derivative entities operating under its authority,
- governance mechanisms or invariants,
- and systems whose failure could cause material harm.

---

## What to Disclose

Responsible disclosure includes, but is not limited to:
- security vulnerabilities,
- invariant violations,
- governance bypasses,
- exploit paths,
- ambiguity that materially increases correction cost,
- or failures that enable harm propagation.

If uncertain, disclosure is preferred.

---

## How to Disclose

Disclosures should be made privately and in good faith.

The recommended method is:
- direct contact via the official contact channel listed on this site.

Disclosures should include:
- a clear description of the issue,
- affected components or documents,
- reproduction steps where applicable,
- and any relevant supporting material.

Anonymous disclosure is permitted.

---

## Handling and Response

PlainSight Lab will:
- acknowledge receipt when feasible,
- evaluate disclosures based on severity and correction cost,
- prioritize issues that affect invariants or enable exploitation.

Response timelines are not guaranteed. Correctness takes precedence over speed.

---

## Coordinated Disclosure

Public disclosure prior to remediation may materially increase harm.

PlainSight Lab requests coordinated disclosure where feasible and reserves the right to delay public acknowledgement until:
- correction is possible,
- mitigations are in place,
- or exploitation risk is reduced.

This request is based on harm minimization, not secrecy.

---

## Safe Harbor

Good-faith disclosures made in accordance with this policy will not be treated as hostile acts.

Disclosure does not grant authority, ownership, or influence.

---

## Refusal and Non-Engagement

PlainSight Lab may decline to engage with disclosures that:
- are made in bad faith,
- are primarily promotional,
- or attempt to leverage disclosure for control, payment, or influence.

Refusal does not invalidate the underlying issue.

---

## Closing

Responsible disclosure is a governance act.

It exists to preserve correctness before correction becomes costly or impossible.
