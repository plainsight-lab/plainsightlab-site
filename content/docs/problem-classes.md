## Overview

This document defines the formal **Problem Classes** addressed by PlainSight Lab.

Problem classes are **structural**, not domain-specific. They describe recurring failure modes that emerge across finance, AI systems, and social infrastructure when adversarial behavior, automation, and delayed correction interact.

A system may instantiate multiple problem classes simultaneously. Effective containment requires addressing **all active classes**, not only the most visible one.

This registry exists to prevent misdiagnosis.

## PC-1: Unbounded Error Propagation

**Definition**  
Systems in which errors propagate faster than humans can identify and correct them.

**Structural Conditions**
- High execution speed
- Delayed or indirect observability
- Costly or irreversible actions
- Human-bound correction pathways

**Failure Mode**  
Local mistakes compound into systemic failures before intervention is possible.

**Containment Strategy**
- Early identification mechanisms
- Pre-execution constraints
- Invariant enforcement at decision boundaries

**Derived From**
- Systems Thesis — *The Problem Class*
- Truth & Governance Evolution — *Phase 1*

## PC-2: Adversarial Incentive Exploitation

**Definition**  
Systems where participants are structurally incentivized to probe, exploit, or manipulate rules for advantage.

**Structural Conditions**
- Competitive or zero-sum dynamics
- Rule complexity or ambiguity
- Observable reward asymmetry
- Weak or delayed enforcement

**Failure Mode**  
Rules are optimized against rather than complied with. Good-faith assumptions collapse under sustained pressure.

**Containment Strategy**
- Assume adversarial behavior by default
- Remove ambiguity
- Make exploitation visible and costly

**Derived From**
- Systems Thesis — *Adversarial Systems Are the Default*

## PC-3: AI-Accelerated Asymmetry

**Definition**  
Systems where AI reduces the cost of attack, probing, or deception without equivalently reducing the cost of identification or correction.

**Structural Conditions**
- Automated strategy generation
- Scalable probing
- Human-only authority or correction
- No enforced execution constraints

**Failure Mode**  
Error propagation and manipulation occur at machine speed while oversight remains human-bound.

**Containment Strategy**
- Deterministic execution layers
- Explicit authority separation
- Verification before action
- AI as advisory only

**Derived From**
- Systems Thesis — *AI Reshapes the Adversarial Landscape*
- Internal Constitution — *Article VII*

## PC-4: Post-Hoc Governance Failure

**Definition**  
Systems that attempt to govern behavior only after harm has occurred.

**Structural Conditions**
- Audit-based enforcement
- Reactive policy creation
- Punitive rather than preventive correction
- Slow institutional response

**Failure Mode**  
Governance becomes symbolic. Damage is acknowledged but not meaningfully corrected.

**Containment Strategy**
- Governance before scale
- Constraints before execution
- Enforcement through refusal

**Derived From**
- Systems Thesis — *Why Traditional Responses Fail*
- Internal Constitution — *Article V*

---

## PC-5: Authority Ambiguity

**Definition**  
Systems where responsibility, authorship, or decision authority is unclear or diffused.

**Structural Conditions**
- Multiple overlapping actors
- Informal or implicit decision rights
- Weak attribution
- Blurred governance boundaries

**Failure Mode**  
No one can be held accountable. Errors persist because responsibility cannot be assigned or enforced.

**Containment Strategy**
- Singular canonical truth
- Explicit authority boundaries
- Documented responsibility

**Derived From**
- Internal Constitution — *Article II*
- Internal Constitution — *Article III*

---

## PC-6: Incentive Drift

**Definition**  
Systems where local incentives (growth, usability, revenue) diverge from correctness or governance objectives.

**Structural Conditions**
- Product-driven optimization
- Market pressure
- Lack of binding constraints
- Informal exception handling

**Failure Mode**  
Short-term success erodes long-term legitimacy and correctness.

**Containment Strategy**
- Incentive containment
- Mandatory escalation
- Correctness over convenience

**Derived From**
- Derivative Entity Charter Template — *Article VI*

---

## PC-7: Premature Decentralization

**Definition**  
Systems that distribute authority before invariants are stable or governance is bound.

**Structural Conditions**
- Early plurality of implementation
- Weak amendment rules
- Informal governance
- Ideological decentralization pressure

**Failure Mode**  
Fragmentation, incompatibility, and legitimacy collapse.

**Containment Strategy**
- Phase-gated authority distribution
- Constitutionalization
- High amendment thresholds

**Derived From**
- Truth & Governance Evolution — *Phase 1 & Phase 2.5*

---

## PC-8: Self-Perpetuating Authority

**Definition**  
Systems where authority structures resist dissolution even after their original justification expires.

**Structural Conditions**
- Unbounded governance tenure
- No forced transition criteria
- Authority tied to individuals or entities
- Lack of neutral institutions

**Failure Mode**  
Authority becomes extractive, illegitimate, or captured.

**Containment Strategy**
- Explicit obligation to distribute authority
- Designed end states
- Institutional handoff

**Derived From**
- Internal Constitution — *Article IV & Article IX*
- Truth & Governance Evolution — *Phase 3*

---

## PC-9: Observability Collapse

**Definition**  
Systems where identifying harm requires excessive social, political, or personal energy.

**Structural Conditions**
- Power asymmetry
- Social or institutional pressure
- Ambiguous evidence standards
- High false-positive or false-negative cost

**Failure Mode**  
Harm persists because identification is too costly or dangerous.

**Containment Strategy**
- Mechanized detection
- Verifiable signals
- Early identification over late correction

**Derived From**
- Systems Thesis — *Social Safety and Awareness*

## Closing Rule

These problem classes are authoritative classification primitives.

They may be referenced, combined, or instantiated by downstream documents and derivative entities, but they may not be redefined without formal amendment.
