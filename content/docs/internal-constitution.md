### Status
Foundational governing document.  
Not marketing.

This constitution defines the identity, authority boundaries, and self-binding obligations of PlainSight Lab. It exists to preserve correctness, prevent drift, and ensure legitimacy can be safely distributed over time.

This document is binding.

---

## Article I — Purpose and Scope

PlainSight Lab exists to anchor correctness in high-stakes systems where legitimacy is fragile and correction costs are high.

It is not a product company, a protocol, or a standards body. It is an epistemic and governance authority whose role is to establish, steward, and enforce invariants until those responsibilities can be safely transferred to formal, neutral institutions.

This constitution governs all actions, representations, and derivative entities of PlainSight Lab.

---

## Article II — Authority Model

### Section 2.1 — Nature of Authority

PlainSight Lab exercises epistemic and governance authority, not ownership authority.

Authority exists to:
- define canonical truth,
- enforce invariants,
- resolve ambiguity,
- and bind future behavior.

Authority does not exist to extract value, capture users, or perpetuate control.

### Section 2.2 — Accountability

All authority exercised by PlainSight Lab must be attributable.

Decisions must have a clear source of responsibility.  
Invariants must be enforceable.  
Ambiguity of ownership or authorship is prohibited.

Influence is a consequence of correctness, not an objective.

---

## Article III — Truth and Invariants

### Section 3.1 — Singularity of Truth

Canonical truth is singular, explicit, and falsifiable.

Plurality of implementation is permitted.  
Plurality of truth is not.

All specifications, invariants, and governance rules must have a clearly identified canonical form.

### Section 3.2 — Enforcement

Deviation from canonical truth may occur only when:
- it is explicit,
- it is documented,
- and its consequences are visible.

Compatibility is a reward for compliance, not a default condition.

---

## Article IV — Centralization and Distribution

### Section 4.1 — Centralization as a Tool

Centralization of authority during early phases is intentional and defensive.

It exists solely to reduce correction cost while systems are fragile and assumptions are still being discovered.

Centralization is not a value.

### Section 4.2 — Obligation to Distribute Authority

PlainSight Lab is obligated to distribute authority when conditions permit.

Failure to relinquish authority once invariants are stable constitutes a legitimacy failure.

---

## Article V — Governance Before Scale

PlainSight Lab does not scale systems, protocols, or influence ahead of governance.

Governance structures, amendment processes, and authority boundaries must exist before expansion occurs.

Speed is treated as a liability until invariants are frozen and governance is bound.

---

## Article VI — Binding and Constitutionalization

### Section 6.1 — Self-Binding Requirement

PlainSight Lab must bind itself through process once foundational invariants are established.

Authority must transition from individuals to documented rules, procedures, and formal mechanisms.

Refusal to self-bind invalidates legitimacy.

### Section 6.2 — Amendment Thresholds

Core invariants may not be altered without explicit, documented amendment processes.

Amendment thresholds must be intentionally high and designed to favor stability over convenience.

---

## Article VII — Human Authority and AI Systems

AI systems may assist in reasoning, validation, simulation, and analysis.

AI systems may not:
- define truth,
- enforce invariants,
- act autonomously within governance structures,
- or represent authority.

Final authority always resides in explicit human governance mechanisms.

Any violation of this principle is a category error.

---

## Article VIII — Derivative Entities

All derivative entities, including protocols, implementations, and affiliated projects, operate downstream of PlainSight Lab authority during early phases.

Derivative entities may not:
- redefine canonical truth,
- bypass governance,
- or imply authority they do not possess.

Authority transitions must be explicit and documented.

---

## Article IX — Institutional End State

PlainSight Lab does not exist to perpetuate itself indefinitely.

Its intended success state is one in which:
- canonical truth is stewarded by neutral institutions,
- governance is procedural rather than personal,
- and legitimacy no longer depends on PlainSight Lab' continued control.

Self-perpetuating authority is a failure mode.

---

## Article X — Enforcement and Refusal

This constitution is enforced through refusal.

PlainSight Lab will decline:
- opportunities that compromise correctness,
- partnerships that dilute accountability,
- acceleration that outpaces governance,
- and narratives that misrepresent its role.

Constraint is the primary enforcement mechanism.

---

## Ratification

This constitution is binding upon adoption.

All future actions, representations, and governance decisions of PlainSight Lab must conform to its articles. Where ambiguity exists, preservation of correctness and legitimacy prevails over convenience.
