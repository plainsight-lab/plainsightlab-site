## Scope

This document defines the governance framework of PlainSight Lab.

It specifies:
- how authority is exercised,
- how decisions are made and constrained,
- how changes are proposed and evaluated,
- and how governance evolves over time.

This framework is intentionally minimal. It establishes **how governance works**, not exhaustive procedures for every future condition.

---

## Governing Authority

PlainSight Lab exercises governance authority as defined by its **Internal Constitution**.

Authority is:
- epistemic, not proprietary,
- bounded, not absolute,
- exercised explicitly, not implicitly.

All governance actions must be attributable and traceable.

---

## Decision Domains

Governance decisions fall into four primary domains:

1. **Truth & Invariants**  
   Canonical definitions, specifications, and non-negotiable constraints.

2. **Governance Structure**  
   Authority boundaries, amendment thresholds, and stewardship transitions.

3. **Derivative Entity Oversight**  
   Approval, suspension, or termination of derivative entities.

4. **Disclosure & Refusal**  
   Decisions to publish, withhold, or decline participation.

Each decision must clearly identify its domain.

---

## Decision-Making Process

All governance decisions must satisfy the following minimum conditions:

1. **Explicit Proposal**  
   The decision under consideration must be stated clearly and unambiguously.

2. **Authority Check**  
   Confirmation that PlainSight Lab is the legitimate authority for the decision.

3. **Invariant Impact Assessment**  
   Identification of affected invariants or confirmation that none are impacted.

4. **Record of Decision**  
   Decisions must be recorded in durable form, even when made by a single steward.

Silence does not constitute approval.

---

## Amendment and Change

Changes to governance artifacts are permitted only through explicit amendment.

Amendments must:
- identify the artifact being modified,
- state the motivation for change,
- describe the impact on existing invariants,
- and preserve backward legitimacy where possible.

Amendment thresholds are intentionally high for foundational documents.

---

## Stewardship Model (Interim)

During early phases, governance stewardship is intentionally centralized.

This is a **temporary condition**, justified by:
- high correction costs,
- immature invariants,
- and the need for fast, attributable decisions.

Stewardship must transition to documented process as systems stabilize.

Failure to transition constitutes a governance failure.

---

## Enforcement Mechanisms

Governance is enforced primarily through **refusal**, not punishment.

PlainSight Lab may refuse:
- participation in systems that violate invariants,
- partnerships that dilute accountability,
- acceleration that outpaces governance,
- or narratives that misrepresent authority.

Refusal is treated as a legitimate governance act.

---

## Transparency and Disclosure

Governance decisions are disclosed when disclosure:
- reduces ambiguity,
- preserves legitimacy,
- or improves downstream correctness.

Non-disclosure is permitted when disclosure would:
- compromise safety,
- enable exploitation,
- or increase correction cost.

Disclosure decisions are themselves governance decisions.

---

## Evolution of Governance

This framework is expected to evolve.

Governance evolution must:
- follow the phases defined in *Truth & Governance Evolution*,
- increase formality over time,
- and reduce reliance on individual discretion.

Governance may not evolve faster than correctness.

---

## Limitations

This framework does not define:
- operational workflows,
- personnel structures,
- voting systems,
- or external institutional processes.

These are intentionally deferred until warranted by scale.

---

## Closing

Governance exists to preserve correctness under pressure.

This framework establishes the minimum structure required for PlainSight Lab to act legitimately today, while remaining capable of binding itself more tightly tomorrow.
