This document describes the intended lifecycle of truth, governance, and legitimacy across PlainSight Lab and its derivative entities. It exists to align decision-making during early construction, prevent structural drift, and ensure that expansion occurs only when correction costs are safely bounded.

This framework is not a growth roadmap. It is a legitimacy and survivability model.

---

## Phase 1 — Founder-Led Truth Anchoring (Current)

**Single protocol. Single implementation. Single governance authority.**

This phase is correct and necessary. It is not a compromise.

The system is fragile in this phase. Ambiguity is expensive. Correction costs must be minimized.

### Structural characteristics

- **Invariant.org** serves as the canonical protocol specification  
  Truth is explicit, reviewable, and falsifiable.

- **Derivative entities** serve as constrained reference implementations  
  Correctness is demonstrated through execution under governance, not asserted by claim.

- **PlainSight Lab** serves as the governance authority  
  Accountability is explicit. Decisions can be made quickly. Invariants can be enforced.

### Purpose

This phase collapses ambiguity while the system is most vulnerable. Authority is intentionally centralized to establish a stable, testable baseline. Truth is singular by design. Feedback loops are short. Errors are cheap to correct.

This configuration minimizes correction energy while structural assumptions are still being discovered.

## Phase 2 — Protocol Escape Velocity (DeFi 2.0 Adoption)

**Multiple implementations. Shared protocol. Expanded governance.**

This phase is only viable because Phase 1 was disciplined.

### Structural characteristics

- Plurality of implementation is permitted  
- Plurality of truth is not

- Compatibility is separated from control  
- Governance scope expands only after invariants are battle-tested

- The protocol becomes portable without becoming mutable

### Purpose

This phase enables the protocol to survive beyond its original authors. Implementations multiply, but deviation becomes visible and reputationally costly. Compatibility becomes the reward for compliance.

PlainSight Lab does not own the protocol in this phase. It stewards it. Stewardship is retained only until it can be safely distributed.

This distinction preserves legitimacy while preventing premature decentralization.

Historical precedent for this model includes TCP/IP, HTTP, TLS, and POSIX.

---

## Phase 2.5 — Constitutionalization (Binding Phase)

**This is the binding moment.**

This phase represents the point of no return.

### Structural characteristics

- Core invariants are formally frozen  
- Governance rules are codified  
- Amendment thresholds are defined  
- Authority to speak for the protocol is explicitly constrained

### Purpose

This phase transitions authority from people to process.

Founders and early stewards intentionally bind themselves. Invariants become non-negotiable. Change becomes procedural rather than discretionary. Governance becomes legible to external participants.

After this point, speed is intentionally sacrificed in favor of integrity.

The system becomes capable of outliving its creators without losing correctness.

---

## Phase 3 — Standards Body (Institutionalization)

**Neutral authority. Formal process. Slow change. High legitimacy.**

This phase is the most difficult to design in advance.

### Structural characteristics

- Invariant.org functions as a neutral epistemic authority  
- Governance shifts from decision-making to decision-validation  
- Change velocity slows by design  
- Legitimacy replaces speed as the primary moat

### Purpose

This phase preserves trust at scale.

Governance no longer defines truth. It certifies whether proposed changes satisfy established rules. Innovation continues at the edges, while the core remains stable.

This structure is accurately described as an ISO-style standards body for decentralized financial systems.

## Closing

At every phase, governance structure is shaped by system fragility and correction cost. Authority is centralized only when necessary, distributed only when safe, and institutionalized only when legitimacy demands it.

This document exists to ensure that expansion never outruns correctness.
