PlainSight Lab operates from a governance-first design posture.

{{<callout role="note">}}
Scale without constraint increases correction cost.  
Constraint without execution becomes theatre.
{{</callout>}}

The approach is therefore:

1. Define invariants.
2. Bind authority.
3. Implement under constraint.
4. Test under adversarial pressure.
5. Amend only when friction demands it.

## Adversarial Baseline

Systems are designed under the assumption that:

- Incentives will be exploited
- Ambiguity will be weaponized
- Automation will compress reaction time
- Institutional correction is slow

Design must account for this before deployment.

---

## Refusal as Structural Tool

{{<callout role="note">}}
Refusal is not a reaction.  
It is a preventative constraint.
{{</callout>}}

PlainSight Lab declines:

- acceleration that outpaces governance
- implementation that violates invariants
- narratives that misrepresent authority

Constraint preserves legitimacy.

Correct systems require discipline before scale.
