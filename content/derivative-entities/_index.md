PlainSight Lab does not exist to operate products indefinitely.

Derivative entities are structured implementations operating downstream of canonical specifications and governance frameworks.

**They do not define truth**.  
**They implement it**.

## Structural Relationship

All derivative entities are:

- Subordinate to canonical specifications
- Bound by the Internal Constitution
- Subject to governance enforcement
- Required to surface implementation friction upstream

Compatibility is a consequence of compliance.

---

## Authority Boundary

Derivative entities may not:

- Redefine invariants
- Override amendment processes
- Assert governance authority

Authority transitions must be explicit and documented.

Correct systems outlive their initial implementations.
