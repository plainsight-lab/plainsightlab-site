### Systems are contested by default

Execution compounds error.   
Ambiguity is weaponized.   
Correction costs escalate after action.    

Design begins where exploitation is assumed.

## Governance Before Acceleration


Authority is defined before implementation expands.

Stewardship is constitutional, not personal.  
Amendment is procedural, not discretionary.  
Refusal is a structural enforcement mechanism.

Scale without constraint increases institutional fragility.
