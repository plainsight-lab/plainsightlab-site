### Adversarial Systems Are the Default

Errors propagate at machine speed.
Ambiguity is exploited.
Correction becomes expensive once execution occurs.

Design must assume exploitation before deployment.

## Institutional Posture

PlainSight Lab operates at the substrate layer of high-risk systems.

It does not optimize for growth.  
It does not defer governance.  
It does not centralize without declaring it.

It defines invariants.  
It binds authority.  
It implements under constraint.

Correct systems outlive their creators.

## Governance Before Acceleration

Authority is defined before implementation expands.

Stewardship is constitutional, not personal.  
Amendment is procedural, not discretionary.  
Refusal is a structural enforcement mechanism.

Scale without constraint increases institutional fragility.
