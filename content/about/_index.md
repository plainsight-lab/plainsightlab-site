PlainSight Lab is an authority layer.

It exists to identify, steward, and enforce correctness in systems where errors propagate faster than humans can reasonably identify and correct them. These conditions increasingly define modern financial infrastructure, AI-mediated systems, and domains where delayed correction produces irreversible harm.

PlainSight Lab is not a product company.  
It is not a protocol.  
It is not a standards body.

Those artifacts may exist downstream. Authority comes first.

**Orientation**

This site is not an onboarding surface.

PlainSight Lab does not exist to persuade, educate, or market.  
The governing documents are the primary interface.

If you are looking for explanation, narrative, or advocacy, this is not that surface.

For PlainSight Lab’s social commitment and the minimum bar it sets for correctness, see the [Mission](/about/mission/).

## What PlainSight Lab Does

PlainSight Lab operates where systems are:
- adversarial by default,
- amplified by automation and AI,
- and governed poorly by reactive or post-hoc controls.

Its role is to:
- define canonical truth,
- establish and enforce invariants,
- constrain execution before damage occurs,
- and steward governance until legitimacy can be safely distributed.

This work is structural. It precedes scale.

## What PlainSight Lab Does Not Do

PlainSight Lab does not:
- optimize for growth, adoption, or narrative,
- persuade markets or communities,
- replace human authority with automation,
- or perpetuate control beyond its justified scope.

Legitimacy is exercised through constraint, not asserted through explanation.

## How This Site Is Organized

This site is not a marketing surface. It is a registry.

The **Docs** section contains the governing artifacts of PlainSight Lab, including:
- the Systems Thesis,
- the Internal Constitution,
- the Truth & Governance Evolution framework,
- and formally derived problem classifications.

These documents define authority, scope, and obligation. They are the primary interface.

Derivative entities, implementations, and tools operate downstream of these constraints.

---

## Authority and Dissolution

PlainSight Lab is designed to become less necessary over time.

As invariants stabilize and governance becomes formalized, authority is expected to transition to neutral institutions and binding process. Self-perpetuating authority is treated as a failure mode, not a success metric.

Correct systems should outlive their creators.

## Orientation

If you are looking for:
- governance structure, see **Docs**
- problem framing, see **Systems Thesis**
- authority boundaries, see **Internal Constitution**

If you are looking for explanation, persuasion, or onboarding, this is not that surface.

PlainSight Lab exists to make certain failures impossible — not to explain them after the fact.
