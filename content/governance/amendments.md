PlainSight Lab does not treat governance as content. Governing documents are **binding**.

This page defines how changes occur to binding documents and how those changes are recorded.

> **If it is not amended through process, it is not changed.**

---

## 1. What Can Be Amended

Amendments apply to documents that are designated:

- **Active** in Docs, and/or
- identified as canonical sources of truth (constitution, thesis, governance framework, policies)

Draft documents may be edited freely until they become Active.

## 2. Amendment Classes

PlainSight Lab recognizes three amendment classes:

### A) Editorial
Spelling, grammar, formatting, link correction.  
No change in meaning or obligations.

### B) Clarifying
Clarifies existing intent without changing authority, scope, or constraints.  
May add examples, tighten language, or remove ambiguity.

### C) Substantive
Changes meaning, scope, obligations, authority, thresholds, or enforcement.  
Substantive amendments require elevated scrutiny.

## 3. Minimum Requirements for Any Amendment

All amendments must include:

- **what changed**
- **why it changed**
- **who authorized it**
- **effective date**
- **impact assessment** (what downstream artifacts are affected)

Amendments are recorded as **Decision Records**.

---

## 4. Thresholds

- **Editorial**: Steward approval + record entry
- **Clarifying**: Steward approval + record entry + link to impacted docs
- **Substantive**: Steward approval + explicit “Substantive” designation + record entry + cooling-off period

For MVP, the cooling-off period is:

> **72 hours between proposal and ratification**  
> unless the change addresses an active security incident.

---

## 5. Publication and Versioning

When an amendment is ratified:

- the document version is incremented (e.g., v1.0 → v1.1)
- the effective date is updated
- the Decision Record is linked from the amended doc (or referenced in notes)

Previous versions are treated as read-only artifacts.
