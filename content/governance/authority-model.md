# Authority Model

Authority within PlainSight Lab is defined, bounded, and attributable.

Authority does not arise from personality, reputation, expertise, or influence.  
Authority arises only from constitutional definition and documented role.

If authority is not explicitly granted, it does not exist.

---

## Authority Types

PlainSight Lab recognizes three authority types:

### 1. Epistemic Authority

The authority to define canonical truth.

This includes:

- Specification definition  
- Invariant articulation  
- Problem classification  
- Formal correction criteria  

Epistemic authority is constrained by the Constitution and subject to amendment thresholds.

---

### 2. Governance Authority

The authority to bind process.

This includes:

- Amendment ratification  
- Stewardship assignment or removal  
- Enforcement escalation  
- Document activation or retirement  

Governance authority exists to preserve legitimacy and procedural integrity.

---

### 3. Operational Authority

The authority to execute within established constraints.

This includes:

- Publishing  
- Implementation updates  
- Repository maintenance  
- Infrastructure changes  

Operational authority may not override epistemic or governance authority.

Execution cannot redefine truth.

---

## Binding Decisions

A decision is binding only if it is:

- Explicit  
- Attributable  
- Documented  
- Consistent with canonical documents  

Binding decisions must be recorded through the Decision Record process.

Undocumented decisions are non-binding by default.

---

## Authority Boundaries

Authority is domain-specific.

- Technical Steward authority does not override harm assessment authority.
- Harm & Adversarial Systems Steward authority does not redefine canonical specifications.
- Operational authority cannot bypass amendment thresholds.

If a decision exceeds domain authority, it is invalid unless processed through formal governance.

---

## Escalation

When authority domains conflict:

1. Canonical documents prevail.
2. Governance Framework procedures determine resolution.
3. The conflict is recorded.
4. No unilateral override is permitted.

Escalation is procedural — not discretionary.

---

## Refusal as Enforcement

PlainSight Lab enforces authority primarily through refusal.

Refusal may include:

- declining publication  
- withholding activation  
- rejecting non-compliant implementation  
- declining partnership  

Refusal preserves structural integrity when correction cost would otherwise escalate.

---

## Transitional Note

Authority within PlainSight Lab is intentionally centralized during early system phases.

As invariants stabilize and governance formalizes, authority transitions from individuals to documented process.

Long-term legitimacy requires authority to become procedural rather than personal.

Authority exists to bind the present — not to perpetuate itself indefinitely.
