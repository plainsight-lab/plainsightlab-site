# Stewards

Stewardship roles within PlainSight Lab are constitutional offices.

They exist to carry bounded authority in service of invariant preservation, correction discipline, and harm containment.

Stewardship is not ownership.  
It is not branding.  
It is not executive status.

It is accountable authority exercised within clearly defined limits.

Authority flows from the Constitution and governing documents — not from personality, reputation, or influence.

> Stewardship is a constitutional burden, not a title.

## Stewardship Constraints

> **Binding Constraints on All Stewards**
>
> All stewards operate under the following limits:
>
> - Authority is limited to defined domains.
> - Decisions must be attributable.
> - Invariants may not be altered without formal amendment.
> - Silence is not consent.
> - Refusal is a valid enforcement mechanism.
>
> Stewardship exists to preserve correctness — not to accelerate growth.

## Harm & Adversarial Systems Steward

The Harm & Adversarial Systems Steward is responsible for preserving integrity under adversarial pressure and monitoring systemic risk signals.

This office ensures that correction cost remains bounded in environments where harm, manipulation, or exploitation are expected.

### Domain

- Adversarial assumption modeling  
- Harm detection and escalation criteria  
- Risk classification  
- Enforcement threshold signaling  
- Early-warning structural analysis  

### Limitations

The Harm & Adversarial Systems Steward may not:

- unilaterally alter invariants,
- override amendment processes,
- redefine canonical truth.

#### Steward of Record

> **Office Holder:** Elizabeth Schlangen  
> **Identity Record:** [External](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethschlangen/)  
> **Term:** Founding Steward  
>
> **Accountable For:** Harm modeling and adversarial system validation.

## Institutional Note

Stewardship roles may expand, contract, or dissolve through formal amendment.

No steward holds permanent authority.

All offices are subject to constitutional binding and eventual distribution as governance formalizes.

Correct systems outlive their stewards.
