PlainSight Lab governs through explicit documents, constrained authority, and refusal.

This section is the operating interface for governance mechanics: who can decide, how change happens, what is binding, and what is recorded.

**Orientation**

If you are looking for canonical governing documents, start in **Docs**:

- **Internal Constitution** (identity and authority boundaries)
- **Governance Framework** (process, scope, and enforcement model)
- **Truth & Governance Evolution** (how legitimacy is distributed over time)

This section contains the governance *mechanics* that sit downstream of those documents.
