PlainSight Lab operates at the substrate layer of adversarial, AI-amplified systems.
{{<callout role="info">}}
It does not build features first.  
It defines constraints first.

## Design Bias

All systems developed or stewarded by PlainSight Lab assume:

- Adversarial behavior is normal
- AI accelerates both error and exploitation
- Correction energy must remain bounded
- Authority boundaries must be explicit
- Refusal is an enforcement mechanism

---

## Operational Domains

Systems currently under active development include:

- Financial invariant enforcement systems  
- Adversarial detection and decisioning infrastructure  
- AI-mediated research and reasoning environments  

Each system exists to test and harden canonical invariants under real conditions.
