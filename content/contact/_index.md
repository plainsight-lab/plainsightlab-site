## Security Disclosure

If your message relates to a potential vulnerability, security concern, or protocol risk, clearly label the subject line:

Responsible disclosure principles are defined in the Security Posture documentation.

## Governance Correspondence

Governance-related inquiries, constitutional questions, or amendment proposals may be submitted to the same address.

Correspondence does not imply obligation.  
Responses are discretionary and bound by governance constraints.
